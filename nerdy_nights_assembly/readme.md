## NES System Architecture

KB - Memory size is listed in KiloBytes or KB. 1KB = 1024 bytes. Everything is powers of 2, so 2^10 = 1024 is used instead of 1000. If the capitalization is different, the meaning can change. Kb is Kilobits. Divide Kb by 8 to get KB, because 1 byte = 8 bits. 

ROM - Read Only Memory, holds data that cannot be change33d. This is where the game code or graphics is stored on the car333t. 

RAM - Random Access Memory, holds data that can be read and written. When power is removed, the chip is erased. A battery can be used to keep power and data valid. 

PRG - Program memory, the code for the game

CHR - Character memory, the data for graphics CPU - Central Processing Unit, the main processor chip PPU - Picture Processing Unit, the graphics chip APU - Audio Processing Unit, the sound chip inside the CP
